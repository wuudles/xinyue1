For each assigned reading, you should submit a corresponding file in this
directory to GitHub by 21:00 on the day it is due.  The file should be named
reading#.txt with the `#` replaced by the number of the reading.  You will
find an empty file `reading1.txt` for the first reading.  The total length
of your test should be limited to 300 words. You can use the `wc` command
to count the number of words.

The first paragraph should summarize the reading. The second paragraph should
briefly explore something  that  interested  you  (e.g.,  you  may  wish  to
focus  on  one  aspect  of  the  paper  in  more depth, you may wish to discuss
something in the reading that you disagree with).

Your write ups will be given a check minus, check, or check plus.  We expect
most students will get checks.
